incorporate the resources.health and resources.armour-class attributes in the system data module (referred to in system.json)

url, manifest, and download are all fake, default name/value pairs in system.json

Implement a <notes> field into the resources object in template.json so that notes about actors can be stored

Implement the inventory array in template.json to be an array of objects with load, name, gold-value, etc

Implement a weapons array in template.json including name, prof, ability-to-hit, hit-bonus, damage-dice, ability-to-damage

Implement a spells array similar to weapons

Implement a miscast checkbox to show the player when they can cast spells of a certain level

Implement a divine/arcane checkbox

remember, XP can determine level and proficiency bonus

I am operating under the assumption that I will use the types of <Generic> and <NPC> to determine some scripting stuff, they are very similar in template.json

It may be wise to incorporate a <retainer> actor type at some point
